# Vibrotactile_Device
 Vibrotactile Device for Third Year Project. 
 
 This project is intended to be a device in which a user could 
 experience speech through their skin as vibration. This involves using
 the `Phoneme Recogniser` testing and outputting a model to be used
 on this embedded device. Once a phoneme is recognised it is mapped
 to a vibration sequence which is then played on the user's wrist. 
 
 This work was for a university project, and the results and experimentation
 can be found in the report found in my `Phoneme Recogniser` repo. 
 
 This project will continue to see updates and is currently not in a usable
 state due to the device crashing, some fixes have been made with some 
 degree of remedy, but ultimately a re-write of the code from dynamic 
 to static memory appears to be necessary. 
 
 In addition to this re-write I am currently testing the phoneme recogniser
 with the use of ML rather than the current KNN methods. Both this and 
 the `Phoneme Recogniser` project will be updated when progress is made.
