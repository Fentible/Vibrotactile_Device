# Vibrotactile_Device
 Vibrotactile Device for Third Year Project. 
 
 This project is intended to be a device in which a user could 
 experience speech through their skin as vibration. This involves using
 the `Phoneme Recogniser` testing and outputting a model to be used
 on this embedded device. Once a phoneme is recognised it is mapped
 to a vibration sequence which is then played on the user's wrist. 
 
 This work was for a university project, and the results and experimentation
 can be found in the report found in my `Phoneme Recogniser` repo. 
 
 This project will continue to see updates and is currently not in a usable
 state. The latest fix allows the device to run continuously without crashing,
 but only for a small subset. Though steps were made to reduce model size, 
 the model still requires a substantial number of prototypes, leading to high 
 memory usage and slow time-to-test. As such the focus will remain on 
 implementing a new classification method to reduce these requirements.
